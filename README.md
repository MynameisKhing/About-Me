# 🐻‍❄️ About Me

**`Computer Engineer`**|

I have been interested in technology since I was a child, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. 
I aim to apply my knowledge in meaningful and practical ways. I am particularly interested in IoT, web development, and AI. 
I am always ready to grow and explore new ideas.
